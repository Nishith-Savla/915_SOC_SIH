We have used React for the frontend, and flask and python in the backend.
We used API calls from the National Vulnerabilities Database and Common weakness enumeration.
The datasets and the python notebooks where ML models are implemented have been uploaded in the backend folder.
To run this code, make sure to have ELK setup on the system and install the libraries from requirements.txt.
